# Zalgo Text: A Form of Textual Art

Zalgo text, also known as "glitched" or "corrupted" text, is a type of text generated by incorporating additional characters into the original text. These characters often appear as if they are encroaching upon the letters, creating a distorted or eerie appearance. Zalgo text is named after a fictional cosmic entity, symbolizing chaos and the unknown.

## Characteristics of Zalgo Text:
- **Overlapping Characters**: Zalgo text is characterized by characters that seem to overlap or encroach upon the surrounding text.
- **Distorted Appearance**: The appearance of Zalgo text is often distorted, glitchy, or eerie, adding a sense of chaos or corruption to the text.
- **Use of Diacritical Marks**: Zalgo text heavily utilizes diacritical marks - accents, tildes, and other marks placed above or below characters.

## Generation of Zalgo Text:
- **Automated Generators**: Online tools and generators can create Zalgo text by automatically adding diacritical marks to the input text.
- **Manual Creation**: Advanced users can manually create Zalgo text by inserting diacritical marks and other characters using Unicode.

## Uses of Zalgo Text:
- **Artistic Expression**: Some individuals use Zalgo text for artistic expression or to create a unique stylistic effect.
- **Online Communication**: It's sometimes used in online communication to convey a spooky or eerie tone, especially during Halloween.
- **Creative Works**: Zalgo text can be used in creative works like horror stories, comics, or other mediums to add a sense of unease or disturbance.

## Considerations:
- **Legibility**: Zalgo text can be difficult to read and may not be suitable for formal or professional communication.
- **Compatibility**: Not all platforms or text rendering systems display Zalgo text correctly, which may affect its appearance and legibility.

## Integration with Obsidian:
- **Styling Notes**: While Obsidian may not natively support the rendering of Zalgo text, using external tools to generate Zalgo text and then pasting it into Obsidian can add unique stylistic elements to notes.
- **Creative Titling**: Use Zalgo text for creative titling of notes or sections within a broader theme, like a Halloween-themed collection of notes.
