# Heroku Alternatives

Herokuâ€™s free tier is dead, but many better alternatives exist for developers. Below are categorized alternatives for different use cases:

## Docker Image Deployment
- **Railway** (best, easiest to use)
- **Render** (all-in-one solution)
- **Fly.io** (regional deployment focus)
- **AWS** (advanced, complex setup)
- **GCP** (similar to AWS)
- **DigitalOcean** (simpler VPS solution)

## Website Hosting
- **Vercel** (easiest for static/dynamic websites)
- **GitHub Pages** (static hosting)
- **Cloudflare Pages** (static hosting with edge capabilities)
- **Render** (dynamic and static hosting)
- **AWS** (hard mode for hosting)
- **GCP** (similar to AWS)

## Database Hosting
- **Railway** (easiest to start with)
- **PlanetScale** (scalable, MySQL-compatible)
- **Supabase** (Postgres-based)
- **CockroachDB** (distributed SQL database)
- **Atlas** (MongoDB hosting)
- **AWS** (RDS for managed databases)
- **GCP** (Cloud SQL, Firestore)

## Specialized Tools
- **Flight Control** (frontend/backend integration)
- **Deno Deploy** (for JS/TS-centric projects)
- **IBM Cloud** (enterprise-grade)
- **Netlify** (alternative to Vercel for websites)

This transition away from Heroku presents an opportunity to explore superior tools tailored to specific needs.
