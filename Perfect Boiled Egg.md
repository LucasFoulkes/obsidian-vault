# Scientists Crack the Code to the Perfect Boiled Egg With a Game-Changing Method

**Published by Springer on February 6, 2025**

Researchers have developed a novel technique—**periodic cooking**—to achieve the ideal boiled egg by optimizing both the egg white and yolk textures. This method leverages controlled temperature cycling to address the different coagulation points of the egg’s components.

## The Periodic Cooking Method

- **Concept:**  
  Traditional methods face a dilemma: boiling at 100°C (212°F) fully sets the yolk but risks overcooking the white, while sous vide (60–70°C or 140–158°F) can leave the white underdone. Periodic cooking overcomes this by cyclically exposing the egg to high and low temperatures.

- **Procedure:**  
  1. **Alternating Temperatures:**  
     - **Boiling Water:** The egg is placed in boiling water at **100°C (212°F)**.  
     - **Cool Water:** Every two minutes, the egg is transferred to cooler water at **30°C (86°F)**.
  2. **Duration:**  
     - This cycle is repeated for a total of **32 minutes**.
  
- **Temperature Dynamics:**  
  - During the cycles, the egg white experiences a range between approximately **35°C and 100°C**, which allows it to gradually set without becoming rubbery.  
  - The yolk, meanwhile, remains around **67°C**, ensuring a soft and rich consistency.

## Benefits and Insights

- **Texture & Taste:**  
  Periodically-cooked eggs boast a soft yolk akin to sous vide eggs, with a white that is well-set yet not overcooked—striking a balance between traditional hard- and soft-boiled eggs.
  
- **Nutritional Perks:**  
  Chemical analysis (using methods like Nuclear Magnetic Resonance and High-Resolution Mass Spectrometry) shows that these eggs also have higher levels of polyphenols, which may enhance nutritional value.

- **Scientific Approach:**  
  The team, led by Pellegrino Musto, utilized computational fluid dynamics simulations to fine-tune the temperature cycling for optimal results. This method not only improves texture but might also have broader applications in material curing and crystallization.
