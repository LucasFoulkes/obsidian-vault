# Bussines AI
## What it do
1. its given information about a bussines, photos of notebooks, organigrams, excell shets used, acces to sql database. 
with this information it should create a document or documents that describe the bussines in its totality this documents shoudl be understood by an ai.

what types of data? like in what bins should the data retrieved be categorized how should it be categorized. 
### 1. **Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN)**

**Purpose:** Visualize detailed workflows and processes. **Example:** Diagrams depicting steps like planting seeds, watering, pest control, and packaging, with decision points for growth and quality checks.

### 2. **Business Architecture Frameworks**

**Purpose:** Outline business capabilities, processes, and organizational structure. **Example:** Identify key capabilities (flower cultivation, quality control, sales), map out processes (order processing, inventory management), and define roles (farm manager, cultivation team).

### 3. **Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD)**

**Purpose:** Illustrate data structures and relationships. **Example:** Entities include Flower, Order, and Supplier, showing relationships such as flowers being supplied by multiple suppliers and orders containing multiple flowers.

### 4. **Open Business Process Model (Open BPM)**

**Purpose:** Model and analyze business processes using a standardized approach. **Example:** Outline the sales and fulfillment process from order receipt through packing and shipping.

### 5. **IIBA Business Analysis Body of Knowledge (BABOK)**

**Purpose:** Define and document business requirements and analysis standards. **Example:** Specify functional requirements for order management and inventory systems, as well as non-functional requirements for performance and security.
