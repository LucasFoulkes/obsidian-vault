# 3D Printed Pet Robot: Snoopy

Snoopy is an open-source 3D printed pet robot designed for DIY enthusiasts and those interested in getting started with robotics. It serves as a practical and fun platform for learning and experimenting with robotics and 3D printing.

## Key Features:
- **Physical Dimensions**: Snoopy has a 300mm round base and is considered a mid-size indoor pet robot.
- **3D-Printable**: The body of Snoopy is 3D-printable, offering a hands-on experience in 3D printing and assembly.
- **Modifiable Design**: The design is meant to be modifiable, allowing for personalization and experimentation.
- **Interactive Capabilities**: Once complete, Snoopy can mimic pet-like behaviors such as playing ball, hide-and-seek, and greeting its owners at the door.
- **Autonomous Navigation**: Equipped with sensors and software for room mapping and autonomous indoor navigation.

## Core Components:
- **Micro-controller**: Utilizes an ESP32 micro-controller along with Arduino firmware for controlling the robot.
- **Sensors**: Equipped with 2 bumpers, 4 bumper sensors, and 5 cliff sensors to interact with the environment.
- **Display**: A smartphone or a 7” tablet can be used as a head display for Snoopy.

## Software Platform:
- **[Kaia.ai](https://kaia.ai)**: Snoopy is compatible with the Kaia.ai software platform built atop the Robot Operating System 2 (ROS2), providing a beginner-friendly interface for interacting with and programming the robot.

## DIY Build Resources:
- **3D Printing Files**: The STL, 3MF, and Fusion 360 source files are available for 3D printing the body of Snoopy.
- **Electronics**: Detailed KiCAD and PDF schematics along with a Bill of Materials (BOM) are provided for the electronics setup.
- **Software Setup**: Instructions for PC setup and firmware are available to get Snoopy up and running.

## Development Phase:
- Snoopy is still under development with more features and improvements planned for the future. Interested individuals can join the Maker's Pet community on [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com) and [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com) to stay updated on the project progress.

## Linking Strategies in Obsidian:
- **Project Linking**: Create a main note for the "Snoopy Pet Robot Project" and link to separate notes for its features, core components, software platform, DIY build resources, and development phase. This will provide a structured overview of the project and easy navigation through different aspects of it.
- **Tagging**: Utilize tags like #Robotics, #3DPrinting, #DIY, and #SnoopyRobot for easy filtering and retrieval of related notes.

## PARA Integration:
- **Projects**: Have a dedicated project note for building Snoopy or for exploring robotic projects.
- **Areas**: Under an area like 'Robotics', link to Snoopy and other related robotic projects.
- **Resources**: Create resource notes for the software platform, DIY build resources, and other related resources.
- **Archives**: Archive any completed projects or phases related to Snoopy or robotics in general.
