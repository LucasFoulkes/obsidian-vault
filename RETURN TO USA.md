## Reflections and Thoughts

### Main Purpose: Relationship Dynamics with Payal

- **Current situation:** Frustration due to missed opportunities and perceived mixed signals.
- **Negative experiences:** Two days of behavior I find shameful and unattractive.
- **Questions and Hypotheses:**
    - Is her willingness to engage in a sexual relationship conditional on dating, and does this apply uniquely to me?
    - Could a decrease in attraction be a result of increased closeness over the past month?
    - Self-analysis: My desire to engage with her seems to stem more from feelings of humiliation and a need to assert myself rather than genuine attraction.
