# React Concepts: Components, Hooks, and Services

This summary presents key concepts in React and differentiates between components, hooks, and services. It serves as a reference for students and developers to understand their roles in application development.

## React Folder Structure Guide

React project organization can evolve based on the size and complexity of your project. Here are three different stages for structuring your project:

### 1. Beginner Folder Structure

This structure is mainly used for smaller projects.

- Three main folders: components, hooks, tests.
- All components go in the `components` folder, hooks go in the `hooks` folder, and tests in the `tests` folder.
- Utility functions and context usually live directly in the `src` folder.

```bash
src/
├── components/
├── hooks/
└── tests/
```

### 2. Intermediate Folder Structure

For larger projects, this structure introduces more folders to separate concerns.

- New folders: assets, context, data, pages, utils.
- Each page has its own folder containing components and hooks unique to that page.

```bash
src/
├── assets/
├── components/
├── context/
├── data/
├── hooks/
├── pages/
│   ├── HomePage/
│   │   ├── components/
│   │   └── hooks/
│   └── LoginPage/
└── utils/
```

### 3. Advanced Folder Structure

Ideal for large, enterprise-scale applications.

- Introduces a `features` folder, which encapsulates all components, hooks, and services related to a specific feature.
- Other new folders: `lib` (for third-party libraries) and `services` (for API interactions).

```bash
src/
├── assets/
├── components/
├── context/
├── data/
├── features/
│   ├── Authentication/
│   │   ├── components/
│   │   ├── hooks/
│   │   └── services/
│   └── ToDo/
├── hooks/
├── lib/
├── pages/
├── services/
└── utils/
```

### Best Practices

- Choose the folder structure that suits the size and complexity of your project.
- Place test files next to the actual code being tested for easier association.

## Understanding React Concepts: Components, Hooks, and Services

- **Components**: These represent the visual elements on the screen. They are reusable and can be nested inside other components to build complex UIs.

```jsx
function Welcome(props) {
  return <h1>Hello, {props.name}</h1>;
}
```

- **Hooks**: They allow you to manage state and side effects in those components. 

```jsx
import { useState } from 'react';

function Example() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
  
  return (
    <div>
      <p>You clicked {count} times</p>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>
        Click me
      </button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

- **Services**: They handle external operations such as network requests. 

```javascript
import axios from 'axios';

export const fetchData = async () => {
    const response = await axios.get('https://api.example.com/data');
    return response.data;
}
```

Remember, the goal is to keep your project organized and maintainable as it grows. Choose the structure that best suits your needs and use these concepts wisely to create effective React applications.
