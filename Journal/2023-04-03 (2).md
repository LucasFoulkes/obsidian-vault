today i feel the passing of time, sometimes i feel the weight of years, sometimes i feel 13 small and full of future.  I know im not, I know the mess that is my past and i feel dislocated, why must i bee so old and feel so young?
the trip was nice mostly, Manisha didnt went that well perhaps she will never want to go out for drinks again. payal and kristen went well. 
the reason of this trip was getting the vr simulator machine. In honesty the trip was unecessary. all was in order and i ended up having to trust the man in more than initially planned, the know shipper was a innefective asshole. perhaps incompetent. also meet melanie. it was also quite nice. 
i will try to behave more intentionally and be less silly. and drink with more control. being unable to experience physical consquences leads to being quite irresponsible.
