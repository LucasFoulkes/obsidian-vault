most important part of the app is the user experience. In this case , the waiter using the app there are diferent ways to aproach . 
1. the app never closes . hence it only works when is open. the table cannot so a loud noise is produced ( a noise loud enough can also give the impresion of vibration to some degre) **criticism** kinda hacky the app should work when the tablet is in unplanned states, even in sleep mode wich seem to reach costnatly. 
I will try different aproaches to arrive at a succesfull notification while. if this is not possibel i will reduce the scope of the project. 

there are two main ways to make an app. 
1. something like a pwa. seems if it works it cannot be it does not get its own icon . so not very profesional
2. native solutinon kotlin or something like it

Using a native solution. 
react native
kotlin
flutter
