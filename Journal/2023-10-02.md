might start a new company with payal. while i have little hopes of this working i can get a free trip and maybe visit k. that is a friendship that needs watering more often i think. the robot project is going slowly. managed to make an unprecendted advance witht the d435i camera using it as a regular stereo. also somewhat gave up on the bus macias thing. doubt he will pay me. 
my vr bussines is not doing to great. this might be becouse of the mall, the fact that guayaquil es cada vez mas peligroso o porque la verdad no se como llevar un negocio. o probablement una combinacion de los tres.  tengo que hacer dinero de alguna forma :(. i would also like to work on some boiler plates for project.
I been feeling like writing a trashy book . fantasy that is actually science. and magic that teaches you the basics of what programing is. the main character would be a bartender woman i think . 
also a game or a manga , i feel like making one.  i need to organize my time better. also think i finally fucking burned my rpi4 8g . this will suck ass.
