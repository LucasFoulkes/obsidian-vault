Today we advance with the project as much as possible. we have a desing . maybe we finish that. but there is also the part about the comunication with the other devices in the network. also pwa cant be fucking used. at least not on the fucking amazon tablets , maybe make it just for the admin and kitchen . perhaps the fuck no. i will have to make an actual android app for fucking amazon tablets. lets test it first.
## Ways to make a native android app
- android studio 
- react native, does not fuck with notifications. check?
- flutter 
###  React Native using expo 
does not fucking work It seems. needs to be an apk or some bullshit. maybe return if other shit does not work
### Flutter
works in vscode. it think. needs andoird studio i think
