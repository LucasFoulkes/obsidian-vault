goals.
- the macias thing. maybe a lot of money, maybe none, 
logic tells me no money, is to stupid, then again people are very stupid? do MVP.

- the rustic restaurant thing. definitely money but unsure when , not a lot of money tho 700$
work on it on my free time. 

- the food delivery robot . very hard but maybe money? I will enjoy making it so quality of life.

- lets make a portfolio maybe some clients.

the end goal is to go for at least a weekend or a week a month to USA, i guess to hang with Kristen? fuck that is dumb.
If i want a social life the most robust way would be the MBA. how to accomplish this quickly? i will need 2000 to go to usa comfortably
