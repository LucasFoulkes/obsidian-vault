## Behaviour
- When in blank state is an access point. 
	- set as ap
	- when someone connecst to the network it shows an website	
	```c++
	#include <WiFi.h>
#include <ESPAsyncWebServer.h>

const char* ssid = "ESP32-Access-Point";
const char* password = "12345678";

AsyncWebServer server(80);

void setup() {
  Serial.begin(115200);x

  // Set device as a Wi-Fi Station
  WiFi.softAP(ssid, password);

  Serial.print("Access Point IP: ");
  Serial.println(WiFi.softAPIP());

  server.on("/", HTTP_GET, [](AsyncWebServerRequest *request){
    request->send(200, "text/html", "<h1>Hello, world!</h1>");
  });

  // Start the server
  server.begin();
}

void loop() {
  // put your main code here, to run repeatedly:
}
```

- In access point state it can scan other networks.  
	- when in the ap esp32 website you can scan other networks. 
- In access point state it can connect to a new network.
	- you can select one of the networks an input credentials. 
- if connected to the new network if connected to the internet it connects to a specific domain and streams the video.
