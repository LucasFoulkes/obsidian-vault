# 21 Awesome Web Features You're Not Using Yet

This document summarizes some of the most exciting and underutilized features available to web developers today. These features can significantly enhance your productivity and the overall user experience of the websites you build.

## 1. Native HTML Dialogue

The native HTML dialogue is a game-changing feature that simplifies the process of building modal windows. It's a regular HTML element that you can reference by its ID and has built-in JavaScript methods to show and hide it. For example, to show the modal, you can run the `showModal()` method.

```javascript
let dialog = document.getElementById('myDialog');
dialog.showModal();
```

You can close the modal by either submitting a form inside of it with a method of `dialog` or by calling its `close()` method on some other event.

```javascript
dialog.close();
```

## 2. Native Popovers

Native popovers are another feature that simplifies the process of showing and hiding content without the need to write any JavaScript or tricky CSS that uses `Focus` within. You just match the element ID to the `popoverTarget` and you're done.

## 3. Web GPU

Web GPU is the successor to WebGL, allowing browsers and web applications to take advantage of GPUs. This means 3D graphics and games are about to get way faster on the web. Libraries like tensorflow.js support it, which means developers will be able to build web apps where end users can train machine learning models without the need to download a bunch of python libraries or use a notebook in the cloud.

## 4. Container Queries

Container queries allow you to apply different styles to an element based on the size of its parent container, not the viewport. This makes it easier to build responsive websites.

```css
.container {
  contain: size layout style;
}

@container (min-width: 500px) {
  .child {
    /* styles for when the container is at least 500px wide */
  }
}
```

## 5. Color Mix

The `color-mix()` function in CSS allows you to mix two colors in a specified color space. This makes it easier to create gradient effects over multiple elements.

```css
color: color-mix(in srgb, red 50%, blue 50%);
```

## 6. CSS Nesting

CSS nesting allows you to write styles in a more concise and readable way by nesting them inside a parent, eliminating tons of duplicated class names from your code.

```css
.parent {
  color: blue;

  .child {
    color: red;
  }
}
```

## 7. Color Fonts

Color fonts, also known as chromatic fonts, use multiple colors inside of a single glyph. This opens up a whole new world of possibilities because now you can customize the entire color palette of a font and create some crazy effects like 3D gradients.

## 8. Web Vitals Plugin for Chrome

The new Web Vitals plugin for Chrome allows you to measure the performance of any website as you use it. It can pinpoint performance issues like layout shift and point you to the exact element that's causing the problem.

## 9. Array `at()`

The `at()` method allows you to get the last element in a JavaScript array by using negative indices.

```javascript
let arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
console.log(arr.at(-1)); // 5
```

## 10. Structured Clone

The `structuredClone()` function allows you to clone an object into a new reference, making it easier to transfer data from one object to another.

```javascript
let obj1 = { a: 1, b: { c:

2 } };
let obj2 = structuredClone(obj1);
```

## 11. Transform Stream Interface

The Transform Stream Interface allows you to pipe one fetch call into another, making it easier to handle streams of data.

## 12. Import Maps

Import maps allow you to declare a bunch of JavaScript modules all at once, simplifying the process of importing multiple modules.

## 13. Individual CSS Transform Properties

Individual CSS transform properties allow you to modify scale, translation, and rotation more easily.

## 14. Trigonometric Functions in CSS

Trigonometric functions in CSS like sine, cosine, and tangent are incredibly useful if you have circles in your design.

## 15. CSS Initial Letter Property

The CSS initial letter property allows you to make the first letter in an article bigger, just like in a magazine.

## 16. New Viewport Units

New viewport units designed specifically for mobile can take into account if toolbars are opened or not.

## 17. Focus Visible

`Focus-visible` is a more accessibility-friendly way to handle focus on form inputs and buttons.

## 18. Inert Property

The `inert` property can be used on elements to show they lack the ability to move or be focused on.

## 19. View Transitions API

The View Transitions API allows developers to create animations between web pages, making websites behave more like mobile apps that keep the user in context.

## 20. Animation Timeline

The Animation Timeline gives you the ability to control animations based on the scroll position in the browser.

## 21. Importing JSON Directly into JavaScript

There's a TC39 proposal that will allow you to import JSON directly into a JavaScript file in the future.

These are just a few of the many exciting features that are available to web developers today. By taking advantage of these features, you can significantly enhance your productivity and the overall user experience of the websites you build.
