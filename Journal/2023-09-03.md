Writing everyday is dificult :(. not much happens. lied to K about having mono, dont feeling great about that. tooth/jaw hurts less, maybe should go to a doctor. feelind old 30 is scary and sad, havent really done much on my 20s sadness. 
i should do gym tomorrow and money things . I want to go to philly soonishly. Need to hang. Maybe also work on fake photographs for dating profiles. i dont mean make myself look diferent just in more interesting contexts to seem more apealing. the robot project like always is not going anywhere i think is the orientaiton fo the wheels. they dong grip good. 
There is a vr oportunity but again dont see how i would make money from that. still i need to make a presentation and a photomontage of it. lame
Macias app also might give some money. might give none . lame
vr001 did make some money at least enough to pay all expenses yay. i should learn more about hair and skin. starting to thin hair and skin i think starting to sag. I havent been in contact with tinder girl from guayaquil this is for the best she was 20 and smelled of crazy. at least not that crazy my lack of response coused a normal lack of response on her and no further contact. wich in this case while rude i think might have been for the best. I fear that many a girl have felt that way about me. 
is a mix of anoyance awkwardness and in a way consideration? i dont want to lead her on and mantaining a conversation feels like it would lead to that.
