So today I guess yesterday I turned 29, one year away from being 30. I dont feel that old. I dont feel old at all. I missed so much . really didnt enjoy my 20. A part of me wants to cry. but i dont seem to be able. I think Payal did something similar to ask to date. i think i said something like no . she seems somewhat angry at me. Also only much older cousin that i never talk to messaged me for my birthday. next year ill be no one. this makes me very sad. 
I need to make my life more fullfilling and actualize my view of life and age.
