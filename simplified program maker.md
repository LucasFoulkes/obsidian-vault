# Simplified AI-Driven Program Generator and Tester for MVP
## Streamlined Workflow

1. **Requirement Gathering**
   - User provides a brief description of the desired program.
   - AI asks clarifying questions to understand core functionality.
   - User and AI agree on a basic set of requirements.

2. **Basic Design**
   - AI outlines a simple program structure.
   - AI proposes a basic technology stack (e.g., programming language).
   - User approves or requests changes.

3. **Test Case Definition**
   - AI defines a minimal set of test cases covering core functionality.

4. **Iterative Development**
   - AI generates initial code for core features.
   - AI runs the code against defined test cases.
   - If tests fail, AI debugs and refactors the code.
   - Steps repeat until all core features pass tests.

5. **Basic Error Handling**
   - AI adds error handling for common scenarios.

6. **Simple Documentation**
   - AI generates basic inline comments.
   - AI creates a brief README with setup and usage instructions.

7. **User Review**
   - AI presents the MVP code and documentation to the user.
   - User provides feedback or approves the MVP.

8. **Quick Iterations (if needed)**
   - Based on user feedback, AI makes small adjustments.
   - AI reruns tests and updates documentation as necessary.

## Key Points for MVP
- Focus on core functionality only.
- Minimize complexity in design and implementation.
- Prioritize speed of development over perfection.
- Gather user feedback early for future improvements.
