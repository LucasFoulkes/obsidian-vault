## Goal 
know how much money im making.  how money i should expect to make. this should be part of consolidated tracker of money and debts.  need to track how much money the guys say there is. how much money is actually made , how much money is actually deposited on my account.  

## Steps
1. get all the info. 
	1. from whatsapp conversations (wich aparently is where all this info is stored). could get info from the machine itself but sometimes there be errors and often so not very acurate. **using whatsapp**
2. parse this info into a table ( is this called normalisation?)
	1. tables definition ( what is the format for this? is it called schema)
		1. datetime, employee, ride 
3. graph this and get insight. also current question Juliana is charging more, is this hurting sales.
4. create a system to put all the money paid and all the costs and have like the ability to track 

## Log ( or like wathever is called when you follow the steps, aplication?)
1. info from whatsapp. 
	1. Current chat (Reto X Milenium Plaza): From now (assumed to be 14/08/2024) to 14/05/2024.
		1. Older chat (Lukasvr): From 12/11/2023 to 25/06/2023
	we are missing fucking 6 months. likr 50% of data. wich is bad. this data can be gotten from the machine itself. *if the machine has a way of tellegin the diference betwen complated games and games in error. also if the guys didnt delete games becouse that was like a thing they did for a while i think also fuck what was the password??? maybe i dont need the password to acces the rides info*
	3. cant find all the info in the current phone. it seems current chat was created  14 november 2023 aand while it has events like removing people and adding in the chat it doesnt acutally have conversations until 16 may 2024. either a) at some point the conversations where deleted. b) conversation actually never existed until that date ( maube it was a chat created but never used) c) the entire chatlog exists but is not accesible from my devices.
		a) not sure how to test if this is true
		b) check the people added and deleted conversatinos they might be part of the actual group that keept track of this info. 
		c) ask members of the group maybe they have this info. 
		upon further fucking checking seems disapearing messages where activated. so the info is lost maybe. *check online dude* yup seems it cant be recovered.
		**to use phone data and computer records. (hope the reinstall does of game did not fuck with the records)** 
2. info from VRComputer. 
	1. connect to vrc thry anydesk or teamviewer. teamviewer has account linked to google account. 
		1. ask guy in vrc to connect to teamviewer. 
		2. ask for code
		3. download teamviewer
		4. connect
		5. go to app 
		6. go to settings
		7. fuck the password i dont remmeber and also i remmeber stuff was reinstalled. i wonder if this will delete the entire history wich would suck. 
		8. found the data i think is either previous or somethinng. i found inside a file called tmpemails.xlsx *more on this later* inside a folder called VR. 
		9. the file needs to be unzipped to view stuff inside it. 
	2. have acces to computer but cant find file a) use the vr app tools. b) find the foler where rides are stored.  
	3. got info from computer using the email thing. i now the data of al the rides sortof there might be error when employes put 2 players for 1 players so actual money in 3 instead of 5. this is historical data so not terribly important maybe. 
	5. install sometype ssh server (probably already has it installed) connect to it thru ngork or free solution. ( i have done this before so it might be somewhere , the credentails i mean). somethign exists in a firebase something
		1. search in firebase account. lucasfoulkes@gmail.com
		2. it changed ! diferent logo cant find existing proejcts
			1. seems existing proejct is gone somehow. cant find any projects wich i guess not great should chekcs **chekc what hppened to firebase projects**
	6. info from all logs files gdrive. or something.
