EcoEDA, a #KiCAD plugin, helps you find and use parts from your junk bin in new projects. It suggests substitutions during design, based on your available parts. This tool supports pin-for-pin substitutions, alternative suggestions, or creating integrated circuit equivalents from discrete components, saving money and reducing e-waste.
