## The Issue with Static Components

Often, in React, you may start with a simple component that displays a product. However, as requirements grow, you might need to hide certain elements of the component, like the rating or the price. A typical solution might involve using boolean flags to control visibility. This strategy, while valid, doesn't scale well. As requirements evolve, you would need to continuously add more flags or props, making the component less flexible and harder to maintain.

## Composable Components

To avoid this inflexibility, you can use the strategy of **component composition**. This means passing components as props to your parent component, rather than hardcoded data or elements. This allows you to control what is rendered in the parent component by modifying the child components that are passed in. 

With this approach, if you want to hide an element, you simply don't pass it as a prop. If you want to change the order of elements, you reorder the props. The parent component doesn't care about what it renders, just that it renders what it receives.

```jsx
<ProductCard 
    image={<ProductImage />} 
    info={<ProductInfo />} 
    action={<ActionButton />}
/>
```

## Compound Components and Context API

While component composition solves several problems, it introduces new complexities. One of them is the prop drilling issue, where you have to pass down data layer by layer through your components. To tackle this issue, you can use **React's context API**.

In this context, you'll store your product data. Then, instead of passing data through props, child components access this context and take whatever they need from it. Also, to ensure that certain components are used only inside a given parent component, you can use context. If a component that should be a child is used outside of its parent, an error is thrown.

```jsx
const ProductCardContext = createContext(null);
const useProductCardContext = () => {
    const context = useContext(ProductCardContext);
    if (!context) {
        throw new Error("Must be a child of ProductCard");
    }
    return context;
};
```

## Compound Components

To make the usage of your components more descriptive and easier, you can transform them into **compound components**. You attach child components as properties of the parent component. This provides them with a namespace and limits their usage to only inside the parent component.

```jsx
ProductCard.Image = ProductImage;
ProductCard.Info = ProductInfo;
ProductCard.Action = ActionButton;

<ProductCard product={product}>
    <ProductCard.Image />
    <ProductCard.Info />
    <ProductCard.Action />
</ProductCard>
```

Now, you have a more flexible, easy to use, extend, and maintain React component!

*Note: Composable and compound components can make your components more flexible and maintainable, but it might not be necessary for all cases. Consider these strategies only when you need the flexibility they offer, and be careful not to over-complicate things without reason.*
