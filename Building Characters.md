# Character-Building Techniques: Insights from Pro Writers

## 1. Counterintuitive Reactions
- Characters should respond to events in unexpected or unconventional ways to enhance their memorability and depth.
  - Example: In *City of Thieves*, a character laughs after escaping cannibals, reflecting a unique and counterintuitive personality trait.
- Avoid clichés by ensuring reactions are authentic to the character’s personality and believable within the narrative.

## 2. Symbolic and Unique Possessions
- A character’s possessions provide insight into their personality, values, and background.
  - Example: The coin carried by Anton Chigurh in *No Country for Old Men* symbolizes randomness and danger.
  - Example: Symbolic burdens in *The Things They Carried* reveal the internal and external struggles of soldiers.
- Possessions can be metaphorical, offering a layer of symbolic depth to characterization.

## 3. Incorporating Contradictory Traits
- Characters gain complexity when their traits defy stereotypes or expectations.
  - Example: In *Always Outnumbered, Always Outgunned*, Socrates Fortlow is both a hardened ex-convict and a reflective philosopher.
- Contradictions provoke reader curiosity and create nuanced, non-stereotypical portrayals.

## 4. Effective Character Introductions
To engage readers quickly, establish the following early:
1. **Dialogue**: Reflects personality (e.g., Sherlock Holmes’ deductions in *A Study in Scarlet*).
2. **Actions**: Defines their character through behavior (e.g., Arthur Dent lying in front of a bulldozer in *The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy*).
3. **Problems**: Immediate conflicts humanize characters (e.g., Hazel’s cancer in *The Fault in Our Stars*).

## 5. Crafting Likable Characters
- While likability is not mandatory, it can enhance reader engagement.
- Strategies to create relatable or compelling characters:
  - Relatable flaws (e.g., Marianne Sheridan’s struggles in *Normal People*).
  - Strong moral values (e.g., John Grady Cole in *All the Pretty Horses*).
  - Acts of kindness or care for others (e.g., the “Save the Cat” technique).
  - Demonstrating competence (e.g., Lisbeth Salander’s skills in the *Millennium* series).

## 6. Meaningful Habits or Quirks
- Unique habits or quirks should reflect deeper motivations or emotional states.
  - Example: A boy tying strings to objects in response to abandonment issues.
- Ensure quirks have narrative significance and are tied to character development.

## 7. Exploring the Perception Gap
- Introduce a disparity between how characters perceive themselves and how others or readers perceive them.
  - Example: Walter White in *Breaking Bad* justifies his actions as moral, contrasting with viewers’ perceptions.
- This technique enhances engagement by challenging readers to assess the character’s self-awareness.

## 8. Supporting Characters as Foils
- Side characters should complement or contrast with the protagonist, highlighting their traits.
  - Example: Javert and Jean Valjean in *Les Misérables* serve as moral and ideological foils.
- Supporting characters can add humor, contrast, or thematic depth (e.g., Donkey in *Shrek*).

## 9. Past, Present, and Future Dimensions
- Characters should exist across three temporal layers:
  1. **Past**: Unresolved issues or events that haunt them.
     - Example: Struggles with identity in *Small Things Like These*.
  2. **Present**: Active conflicts driving the narrative.
  3. **Future**: Aspirations or fears providing motivation.
- Temporal depth adds realism and emotional complexity to characters.
