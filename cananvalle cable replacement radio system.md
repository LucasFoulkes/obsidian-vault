### **Project Overview: Solar-Powered, Long-Range Radio Control System for Solenoids**

#### **Key Components (for Both Options)**:
1. **LoRa Module**: A long-range, low-power communication module.
2. **Solar Panel**: Converts sunlight into electricity to power the system.
3. **Charge Controller**: Regulates the charging of the battery and power distribution.
4. **Battery (DC)**: Stores energy from the solar panel to power the system during low sunlight.
5. **Cabling**: Connects components and transfers power/data to solenoids.
6. **Bus System**: Addressing system to activate specific solenoids.
7. **Solenoid Cabling**: Wires delivering power and control signals from the controller to solenoids.

### **Path A: Reuse Existing AC Solenoids**

#### **System Setup**:
1. **Reuse of Existing AC Solenoids**:
   - **Advantages**:
     - Lower initial cost since existing solenoids remain in place.
     - No need for replacing solenoids, reducing labor and material costs.
   - **Disadvantages**:
     - Requires a DC-to-AC converter, introducing power inefficiency.
     - Likely need for larger solar panels and batteries due to energy loss in conversion.

2. **Additional Component**: 
   - **DC-to-AC Inverter**: Converts DC power from the battery into AC for the solenoids.
   - **Considerations**:
     - Conversion losses reduce overall system efficiency.
     - The inverter must be properly sized to handle the solenoid power requirements.

#### **Feasibility**:
- **Pros**: Minimal changes to existing infrastructure, quicker installation.
- **Cons**: Increased energy consumption, lower efficiency, and potentially higher long-term costs.

### **Path B: Install New DC Sticky Solenoids**

#### **System Setup**:
1. **New DC Sticky Solenoids**:
   - **Advantages**:
     - Higher energy efficiency since no conversion is required (direct DC power).
     - Sticky/latching solenoids can hold their position (open/closed) with minimal power usage.
   - **Disadvantages**:
     - Higher upfront cost for replacing solenoids.
     - Time and labor required to remove old solenoids and install new ones.

2. **Solenoid Type**:
   - **Sticky/Latching Solenoids**: Once activated, these solenoids remain in position, significantly reducing power consumption.

#### **Feasibility**:
- **Pros**: Higher efficiency, lower energy consumption, and better long-term cost savings.
- **Cons**: Higher initial investment and installation effort.

### **Comparison of the Two Options**

| **Feature**                | **Path A: AC Solenoids**                              | **Path B: DC Sticky Solenoids**                       |
|----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| **Initial Cost**            | Low (reuse of existing solenoids)                   | High (cost of replacing solenoids)                    |
| **System Efficiency**       | Lower (due to DC-AC conversion losses)              | Higher (direct use of DC power)                       |
| **Energy Consumption**      | Higher (conversion inefficiency)                    | Lower (sticky solenoids reduce power use)             |
| **Complexity**              | Moderate (requires an inverter)                     | Low (simpler DC-based system)                         |
| **Feasibility**             | Faster installation, no solenoid replacement        | Requires solenoid replacement, long-term savings       |
| **Long-Term Cost**          | Higher (due to energy loss and inefficiency)         | Lower (more efficient, lower operating costs)         |

### **Next Steps**:
1. **Cost Estimation**:
   - **Path A**: Calculate costs for additional cabling, inverters, and extra solar capacity.
   - **Path B**: Estimate the costs for new DC sticky solenoids and installation effort.
   
2. **Feasibility Study**:
   - Evaluate long-term savings in power and maintenance from Path B versus the immediate lower cost of Path A.

3. **Energy Analysis**:
   - Conduct a detailed power consumption analysis for both systems.
   - Use this to determine the appropriate solar panel sizing and battery capacity.

## **Log**

### **Version 1: No Solenoid Replacement (AC Solenoids)**

This version leverages the existing AC solenoids. A DC-to-AC inverter will be used to power the solenoids, ensuring minimal modifications. The system will be modular, allowing for ease of installation and scalability.

#### **Requirements**:

1. **Base System (Control Center)**:
   - **LoRa Module**: $10 - $50 (for long-range communication).
   - **Arduino**: To handle communication between LoRa and the computer.
   - **Computer**: To manage the system and send control signals.

2. **Client System (Solenoid Controller)**:
   - **LoRa Module**: $15 - $50 (for communication with the base).
   - **Solar Panel**: Sized according to energy needs.
   - **Battery**: Adequate capacity to store and supply energy.
   - **DC-to-AC Converter**: To power existing AC solenoids.
   - **Arduino**: For managing solenoid control.

### **Options for Client Solenoid Control**:

1. **Option A: Direct Relay Control**:
   - **Description**: Each solenoid is connected via dedicated cables and controlled individually through relays.
   - **Advantages**:
     - Simple and straightforward wiring, easier to troubleshoot.
   - **Disadvantages**:
     - Requires more cabling, which increases costs and complexity in larger systems.

2. **Option B: Shared Communication Line**:
   - **Description**: A single communication line is shared by all solenoids, each addressed individually.
   - **Advantages**:
     - Fewer cables, making installation easier and less expensive for large systems.
   - **Disadvantages**:
     - More complex setup and harder to troubleshoot, as all solenoids share the same communication line.
### To decide
- cost of cables for each version
1. 
	1. a) the two wire to each. 
	2. b) the 4 wires to all. 
	3. c) 3 wires if change the selenoids
there are many variables in any case should work onthe main thing. the lora connection and the relay thihg. 
list of material
2 loras
2 arduinos
4 arduino for each
4 opto relay for the ac thing
1 battery
1 dc to ac
1 capacitor of comekind to increase the ac voltage?
1 solar panel.
1 solar panel control
1 something to measure the charge int the battery.
