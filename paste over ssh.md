To create an alias that allows you to use `ifconfig | clipb` to copy the output of `ifconfig` to your clipboard, you can add the following alias to your shell configuration file (e.g., `.bashrc` or `.zshrc`):

1. **Open your shell configuration file**:
   ```bash
   nano ~/.bashrc  # or ~/.zshrc, depending on your shell
   ```

2. **Add the alias**:
   ```bash
   alias clipb='printf "\033]52;c;$(cat | base64)\a"'
   ```

   This alias takes any input piped into it, encodes it in base64, and sends it to the clipboard using the OSC 52 sequence.

3. **Reload your shell configuration**:
   After saving the changes, reload the configuration by running:
   ```bash
   source ~/.bashrc  # or ~/.zshrc
   ```

4. **Usage**:
   Now you can use the alias as follows:
   ```bash
   ifconfig | clipb
   ```

   This command will copy the output of `ifconfig` to your clipboard.

This alias is versatile and can be used to copy the output of any command to your clipboard by simply piping the output to `clipb`.
